    Increasing the timeout because the "Auto-install" question will
    often not arrive because we have installed everything already. So
    then we must see the EOF otherwise we will believe we could not
    answer a question. This here also includes the patch mentioned here:
    http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=40144

match:
  distribution: "/Net-SSLeay-1\.35\.tar\.gz"
  perlconfig:
    osname: freebsd
    osvers: "^[789]\."

  - SREZIC/patches/Net-SSLeay-1.35-PetrSalinger-01.patch

    mode: anyorder

    reuse: 1

      - "n\n"
      - "Auto-install"
