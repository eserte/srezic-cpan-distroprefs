# On Linux systems (Debian, CentOS) there's
# a tclsh installed which usually points to the
# latest (or last) installed Tcl
# FreeBSD has only version-specific tclsh
# installed
#
## Old comment follows:
# FreeBSD has tclsh8.4, tclsh8.5, and tclsh8.6
# Building works only with tclsh8.4.
# To build with 8.5 and 8.6, the --nousestubs has to be used.
# But this seems to cause failures in modules depending on Tcl (e.g. Tkx)
# On the other hand, Tkx seems to expect tclsh8.5.
