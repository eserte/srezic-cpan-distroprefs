## perl Makefile.PL says:
##   Version of your libthai is 0.1.5.  0.1.9 or later is required.  Update it or specify --disable-libthai option.
## It seems that libthai 0.1.19 is now in
## the ports, but it's not installed on
## my systems.

#  commandline: "limits -t 30 make test"
#comment: Runs forever on freebsd systems if libthai 0.1.5 is installed, ok with libthai 0.1.12+libdatrie 0.2.2
