## The following does not work, at least with CPAN 1.9600
#---
#match:
#  distribution: "/BioPerl-\d"
## First alternative: hack the CPAN::Config setting
#cpanconfig:
#  mbuildpl_arg: "--accept"
## Better alternative: use the distropref setting. But
## this unfortunately works only for EUMM, it seems. Problem is
## that one does not always know whether EUMM or MB is used,
## so the real solution would need to use another keyword than
## pl (!)
#pl:
#  args:
#    - "--accept"
