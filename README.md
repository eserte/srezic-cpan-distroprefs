srezic-cpan-distroprefs
=======================

A collection of distribution preferences for CPAN.pm

This directory contains a number of files for the
[CPAN.pm distroprefs system](https://metacpan.org/pod/CPAN#Configuration-for-individual-distributions-Distroprefs).

In a nutshell, use these files if you encounter problems when
installing or testing CPAN modules â€” maybe the solution for the
problem is already contained here.

*How to use it*: you can git-clone the whole directory into
`~/.cpan/prefs` or `~/.local/share/.cpan/prefs` (depending on your CPAN.pm
distribution). However, it's recommended to pick only the distropref
files you really need, so just copy or symlink these files only. Most
files are named after the CPAN distribution (e.g. `X11-Xlib.yml` for the
CPAN distribution `X11-Xlib`).

Also make make sure that a YAML module is installed, either `YAML` or
`YAML::Syck`. Not all of the files are compatible with `YAML::XS`
(yet), so make sure that the CPAN configuration option `yaml_module`
is *not* set to `YAML::XS`.

*How to check if it worked*: While `CPAN.pm` is building a module, and a
matching distropref file is found, you'll see something like
```
______________________ D i s t r o P r e f s ______________________
                           X11-Xlib.dd[0]                           
```
in the log output.

*Details*: some of the distroprefs files make use of the "except"
feature to automatically answers interactive questions. This feature
requires an installed `Expect` module, so make sure that this module
is installed. `Expect` does not work on Windows systems --- in this
case the distroprefs files have to be rewritten. Often an environment
variable for turning off the interactivity exists (e.g.
`PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT=1`), or `perl Makefile.PL` accepts further
commandline arguments to set options.
