# Image::Magick (aka PerlMagick) is known to work only exactly
# specific imagemagick releases, i.e. usually it does not
# work with an imagemagick already installed from the
# system's package manager.
#
# To install a matching Image::Magick e.g. for a self-compiled
# perl you can use the following helper scripts on
# Debian Linux and FreeBSD:
#
#   https://github.com/eserte/srezic-misc/blob/master/scripts/install-imagemagick-on-debian.pl
#   https://github.com/eserte/srezic-misc/blob/master/scripts/install-imagemagick-on-freebsd.pl
#
# Please make sure to read the comments, as the installation
# process is not always smooth.
